3D Audio Interactive Wave Visualization
A Python-based 3D audio interactive visualization program that captures audio through the microphone and generates dynamic 3D wave visualizations in real-time.
Project Description：This project transforms audio signals into real-time 3D wave visualizations. The program analyzes frequency characteristics of microphone input and generates dynamic, responsive 3D wave patterns. As the sound changes, the 3D waves on the screen respond in real-time, creating a unique audiovisual interactive experience.
Features：Real-time audio capture and analysis 
3D wave visualization based on frequency characteristics
Dynamic color mapping
Real-time interactive response
FFT spectrum analysis
Fluid wave propagation
nstallation Requirements：
Basic Dependencies：pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
Audio Library Installation：

Technical Details：Audio Analysis: Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for frequency analysis
Wave Generation: Combines multiple sine waves with parameters controlled by audio features
3D Rendering: Utilizes Matplotlib's 3D surface plotting capabilities
Real-time Processing: Multi-threading for simultaneous audio capture and visualization
Color Mapping: Plasma color mapping based on wave height
Built with Python, PyAudio, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy
